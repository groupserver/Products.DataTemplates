PyXML > 0.8.3

4Suite usage has been deprecated except for XSLT. Particularly
with XPath, 4Suite appears to have some problems that don't seem to exist in
PyXML 0.8.3. If someone wants to fix this so that both work, please send
patches. Note that in Red Hat/Fedora it appears that PyXML has had xpath and xslt
support removed, so you will need to build your own PyXML package. If you
build alternative plugins, and do not use XPath, at this stage the Red Hat/Fedora
packages should still do everything you require.
